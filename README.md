# ECE444-F2023-Lab5
This is the repo for lab 5 of the ECE444 course where we experiment with Test Driven Development (TDD) in Flask

## Pros of TDD
Test Driven Development (TDD) offers several advantages. First, it facilitates consensus among team members regarding the intended functionality of a specific function, ensuring a shared understanding. TDD also enhances code quality by compelling developers to test their code with a variety of input scenarios, which diminishes the likelihood of introducing bugs. Furthermore, it contributes to long-term code stability by requiring that tests pass after any code modifications, preventing regressions. Finally, TDD aids in project timeline estimation by providing a quantitative measure of progress, enhancing project management and planning.

## Cons of TDD
Test Driven Development (TDD) also comes with its set of drawbacks. One of the key disadvantages is the extra time required to design and implement the tests, potentially extending development timelines. As the project evolves and becomes more intricate, some of these tests may need ongoing maintenance, which can add overhead. Additionally, certain parts of the code may be particularly challenging to test in isolation, necessitating specialized frameworks for execution. Enforcing a strict adherence to the practice of adding unit tests for all code within a development team can be difficult, posing a potential organizational challenge.
